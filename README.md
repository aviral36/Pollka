A basic Polling app developed using Django package on Python.

This repository contains all files that build up an entire polling application. 
It is an implementation of django tutorial's guide to start building apps. 

Access admin page by invoking manage.py to connect to server by `runserver` command.
Connection server is: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/
Login with credentials ONLY after you have configured the superuser of Pollka. Add yourself as an admin to enable script manipulations.

Start polling by switching to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/

### NOTE: DO NOT CLOSE CMD WHILE SERVER IS RUNNING.
To exit the server, press CTRL+C on cmd.

##### That's it! Get going!
